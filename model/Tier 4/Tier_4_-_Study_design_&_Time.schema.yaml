title: OpenDrawer Metadata Tier 4 - Study design & Time
type: object
properties:
  ? 'The stable, unique identifier for a study that never changes, even if other study
    metadata changes (like the study name, short name, owner, or project). Example:
    STUDY_SCA'
  : type: string
    description: Free-text clarification (optional)
    x-optional-persistent-row-identifier: Use studyID as the anchor, plus a persistent
      row identifier to identify a specific file/version, etc.
    x-optional-persistent-row-identifier-value: Enter a unique identifier for the
      selection made.
    x-optional-appliesto: Indicates the level of entity to which a metadata value
      applies (e.g., individual participant or population summary).
    x-optional-aggregationlevel: Specifies whether a metadata value represents individual-level
      data or an aggregate summary
    x-optional-populationscope: Identifies the population described by the metadata
      (e.g., study-wide, cohort, or study arm).
    x-temporalcoverage: The time period or periods during which data were collected
      for a study, cohort, or variable, summarized at an aggregate level.
    x-startyear: Earliest calendar year of data collection
    x-endyear: Latest calendar year of data collection
    x-years: Explicit list of years, if non-continuous. Four-digit integers (e.g.,
      2019)
    x-seasons: Seasons during which data were collected
    x-enrollmentage: The age or ages of a participant at the time of enrollment or
      at defined enrollment-related timepoints in a study, including single ages,
      age ranges, or multiple ages associated with longitudinal or staged enrollment.
    x-enrollmenttimepoint: A named study milestone at which enrollment occurs (e.g.,
      baseline, re-enrollment, extension phase).
    x-administrationcontext: The physical or situational setting in which a data collection
      activity or assessment is administered. Describes where data collection occurs,
      not how, who, or what. Intended for general or summary-level reporting, not
      per-participant metadata.
    x-collectionmodailty: The primary mode by which data were collected for a variable
      or assessment.
    x-recruitmentwave: Enrollment wave (baseline, follow-up, etc.). Identifies the
      recruitment phase or wave during which participants were enrolled in a study,
      reflecting distinct enrollment periods defined by study design or operational
      milestones.
    x-studywaves: The recruitment or enrollment wave(s) represented in the study population.
    x-if-not-provided-as-a-row-identifier-studywaveid: 'A stable identifier for a
      defined recruitment wave or enrollment phase within a study. Examples: WAVE:1,
      WAVE:2, WAVE:PILOT, WAVE:EXTENSION'
    x-if-not-provided-as-a-row-identifier-studyperiodid: 'A stable identifier for
      a defined time period during which data collection occurred under consistent
      procedures or conditions. Examples: PERIOD:BASELINE, PERIOD:FOLLOWUP_6MO, PERIOD:COVID_ERA,
      PERIOD:2020_2021'
    x-if-not-provided-as-a-row-identifier-studyarmid: 'A stable identifier for a defined
      study arm, group, or condition assignment used to structure participant enrollment,
      intervention, or comparison. Examples: ARM:CONTROL, ARM:TREATMENT_A, ARM:HIGH_RISK,
      ARM:CASE, ARM:COMPARATOR'
    x-if-not-provided-as-a-row-identifier-studycomponentid: A stable identifier for
      a defined component of a study (e.g., wave, arm, period) used to scope metadata
      summaries.
    x-studycomponenttype: The category of study subcomponent identified by studyComponentID
      (e.g., wave, arm, period), used to indicate what kind of study structure the
      component represents for scoping metadata summaries.
    x-followupyear: 'Years since original cohort enrollment. Summarizes the amount
      of time elapsed since original cohort enrollment for which participant data
      are available. Values can be in: minYears, maxYears, years.'
    x-followupyeardescription: Free-text clarification (optional)
    x-if-digital-is-selected-for-collectionmodality-administrationmode: The manner
      in which a digital assessment or data collection activity is administered to
      participants.
    x-if-digital-is-selected-for-collectionmodality-promptingscheduletype: 'EMA schedule
      type. Valid values: free text, OR Multiple, Varies, Unknown'
    x-if-digital-is-selected-for-collectionmodality-promptfrequency: 'Frequency of
      prompts. Valid values: free text, OR Multiple, Varies, Unknown'
    x-if-digital-is-selected-for-collectionmodality-responsewindowminutes: 'Response
      window (minutes). Valid values: free text, OR Multiple, Varies, Unknown.'
    x-rollingenrollment: Indicates whether participant enrollment occurs continuously
      over time rather than within a fixed recruitment window.
    x-studystartyear: The calendar year in which study recruitment or data collection
      began. Use "Unknown" if not available.
    x-burstdesign: A summary description of the study’s burst-based sampling structure
      (bursts, timing, follow-up cadence, and recruitment waves).
    x-numberofbursts: The number of distinct burst periods of intensive measurement
      scheduled per participant.
    x-burstlength: The planned duration of each burst period of intensive measurement.
    x-burstfrequency: The planned frequency at which bursts occur across the study
      timeline.
    x-followupinterval: The planned amount of time between participant follow-up assessments,
      visits, or measurement periods.
    x-hasobservationtimestamp: Indicates whether individual observations/records include
      a date or timestamp of data collection.
