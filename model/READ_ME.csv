Tier 1 - Study Identity & Discovery,Make the study discoverable and uniquely identifiable; provide the minimum context needed to understand “what this is” and relate it to other studies/collections.,Low (usually already known; low sensitivity),
"Tier 2 - Governane, Access & Provenance","Let users understand whether and how the dataset can be accessed and reused (policy + operational access steps), without needing back-and-forth.","Low - Medium (often shareable, but sometimes requires coordination with governance teams. Often easy if links exist; harder if docs are scattered; generally safe to share)",The metadata contribution team can add additional metadata fields to each tab as needed. These metadata may be specific to a study or may be incorporated into the CLASSIC data model over time.
Tier 3 - Cohort & Population,"Describe who is in the study and how the cohort was defined/ascertained, enough for a user to judge relevance before requesting access.",Medium (may require harmonizing terminology; some attributes may be sensitive or restricted → may keep optional where needed),The metadata contribution team can add additional metadata fields to each tab as needed. These metadata may be specific to a study or may be incorporated into the CLASSIC data model over time.
Tier 4 - Study Design & Time,"Describe when and how often data were collected (longitudinal structure, bursts, waves, follow-up intervals, timestamp availability). This is key for interpretation and longitudinal/APC use cases.",Medium (sometimes requires pulling info from protocol/ops docs; typically shareable),The metadata contribution team can add additional metadata fields to each tab as needed. These metadata may be specific to a study or may be incorporated into the CLASSIC data model over time.
Tier 5 - Measures & Instruments,"Describe what was measured (constructs, instrument identity, administration modality/technology) at a level that supports discovery and basic interpretability.",Medium - High (depends on how well instruments are documented and whether devices/platform info is centralized),The metadata contribution team can add additional metadata fields to each tab as needed. These metadata may be specific to a study or may be incorporated into the CLASSIC data model over time.
"Tier 6 - Derived Scores, Variables & Availability Summaries","Make derived outputs interpretable (what a score/variable represents, and its general derivation form), especially when item/trial-level data aren’t shared. Help users answer “is there enough data for my question?” without accessing participant-level files, counts, ranges, units, or timepoint-scoped summaries.","High (often requires analyst input or codebook review, requires computing/curating summaries; may be restricted depending on policy→ may keep optional/add to study later, i.e., ""enrichment"".",The metadata contribution team can add additional metadata fields to each tab as needed. These metadata may be specific to a study or may be incorporated into the CLASSIC data model over time.

Instructions,,,
How to start,,,
"Contribute in tiers. Every study should aim to complete Core. Enhanced and Deep add interpretability and reduce back-and-forth, but may have optional or ""null"" metadata.

Recommended “null reason” pattern (use anywhere a value is missing)

For any field that can’t be provided, either the Sage Team or the metadata contribution team will record a nullReason (or equivalent) using one of:

- Not collected
- Not available
- Not yet curated
- Not shared due to restrictions
- Unknown

1) Core: Start with Modules 1–2 (baseline minimum, lowest burden).

2) Enhanced: Add Modules 3–4 next (makes the dataset meaningfully interpretable).

3) Deep: Treat Modules 5–6 as “measure-level enrichment”. Use as the “DUA decision support” tier (most helpful but most work).
